## Project Motivation
I'm a keen runner. I use running as a main mode of exercise and i use it to focus and discipline myself. Despite not being athletic by any means, i enjoy the self-competative aspect to running and being able to always challenege my own performance and ability.

In this project i will evaluate the last two years performance and stability of heart rate mesurements from my apple watch during workouts. I will use this to determine firstly what patterns can be seen with relation to heart rate and elevation. Using this information i will decide if data modeling would be applicable or if there is too much variation between results.

## Results
