## Project Motivation
I'm a keen runner. Itâ€™s main mode of exercise and I use it to help focus myself. Despite not being athletic by any means, I enjoy the self-competitive aspect in being able to always challenge my own performance and ability.

In this article I evaluate the performance and stability of heart rate measurements from an Apple watch during run workouts. I will use this to gain an insight as to whether any patterns can be seen with respect to heart rate and elevation. Using this information I will decide how accurate it would be to model and predict heart rate measurements to support and improve my performance training.

## Results
